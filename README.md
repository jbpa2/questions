# Questions

Hello, i was thinking... do we live?

## intro

Everything started to be wierd. Nothing is even real anymore. My life, Your life it's all gone.

What does it mean wierd in this system? 

What does it mean life.

## Living

Try to find a pure glass. Try to fill it. Can you really fill it? Or will there be always a way to fill it more?

My life feels that way.

My whole life. 

I've been just looking for answers for what? 

Everything? Nothing?
Is that normal? Do others think that way?
Again more questions...

But what about answers and guestions.
What if it's just the same thing. You can't/can say thats false/true.
It depends on a viewpoint. Always true or false and it can build more complex structures .... like in computers.

So I can say I'm same as computer. Some deterministic machine working as I'm suposed to because something had made me the way I am.
Huh i don't even know I am/this is false/true.

Loose standards holds us to nothing else than nothing.

What would be child doing if it doesn't know concept of anything?

It could be finally free.

Or worse it would be nothing.

The concepts are ways of holding population in line. But for me the line is/was always imaginary/fake. No true and false can meet nothing. 
So there is not just true and false there is nothing too.

But it's not in the same universe.

Where is other universes so simple that they contain nothing at all?

Can there be anything less than nothing?

Can there be anything more than nothing?
